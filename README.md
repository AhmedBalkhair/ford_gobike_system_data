# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Ahmed Balkhair


## Dataset

Bay Wheels is a regional public bicycle sharing system in California's San Francisco Bay Area. It was established as Bay Area Bike Share and was re-launched later as Ford GoBike in a partnership with Ford Motor Company.

The dataset used for this exploratory analysis consists of monthly individual trip data from January 2018 to December 2018 in CSV format covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis of data provided by Ford GoBike, a bike-share system provider.

The initial FordGoBike dataset was consisted of 16 features and 183412 records. The data collected is for February 2019 of approximately 183,412 bike rides in the San Francisco Bay area of California, USA documented.

    - Usually rides on weekdays.
    - Usually rides around 8 am and 6 pm.
    - Usually rides for short distances.
- Customers benefit from it for touring.
    - Usually rides on weekends.
    - Usually rides for long distances.
- The duration and distance of rides is at highest around age 25-35 and slowly decreases when age is older.
- It is an affordable and convenient transportation choice for the people of all socioeconomic classes since the data shows that there is significant amount of rides in each day that are done by all kinds of people (different ages and gender).




## Key Insights for Presentation

> Customers ride a lot on weekends, especially in the afternoon, but subscribers use the system substantially throughout the weekdays, from Monday through Friday. Customers prefer to use more in the late afternoon around 17 pm, but subscribers tend to make more journeys between 8 and 9 am and 17 and 18 pm on workdays. Subscribers' efficient/short periods of consumption are consistent with their high concentration during Monday through Friday rush hours, showing that the use is mostly for commuting to work. The more relaxed and adaptable usage pattern of the customers reveals that they utilize the bike-sharing system somewhat differently from the subscribers, frequently on weekends and in the afternoons, possibly for sightseeing or touring purposes.
